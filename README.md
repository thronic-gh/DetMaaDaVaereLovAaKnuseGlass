## Knusenarr - Play a prank on a gamer  

Play a joke on a gamer you know who uses WASD a lot.  

![Example UI](example_ui.png)  

At certain unavoidable moments, A+W+D will be simultaneously pressed, triggering a visual and audio crack on the users screen every time it occurs. To shut down the harmless executable and all visual cracks, just press L+O+V instead which will confirm shutdown. A batch file for putting the executable in the users startup folder is included. The executable is signed to prevent false AV positives, but may still cause warnings for heuristic reasons.  

If you use the startup script in the release, you can just remove it again from:  
```C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp```
